This is an app for Dungeon and Dragon players to help digigtalize the process of playing.

The DM may set up an account and invite players to join, the DM and the player have joint custody of the character sheet, any changes made by either one will change the character sheet for both. the DM can make notes on the sheets, ask for rolls, or refrence the books, and all without having a thousand resorces infront of them

This is a Players Digital Binder (PDB)
